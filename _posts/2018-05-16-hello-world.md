Launching my own site! Powered by Jekyll and GitHub... it was quite straightforward. Thanks especially to these tutorials:

* [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) This is especially good if you don't know git
* [Brian Caffey's guide](http://briancaffey.github.io/2016/03/17/jekyll-tutorial.html) This includes git, and shows how to incorporate comments and analytics into your blog
* [Repo of sites built off jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites) #inspiration
* [Setting up tags](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) Guide to set up tags
* [Markdown Cheatheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html) Good reference
