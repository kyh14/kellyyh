I was at a meeting once where we were asked to introduce ourselves by a productivity hack. Mine was using Wunderlist to keep track of my life projects, immediate to-do's, and brewing ideas.

There were two other ideas that I wanted to try:
* Use iPhone voice recording apps to dictate performance reviews while you're in the car or doing other errands. The app will automatically transcribe into written paragraphs fairly accurately. I've tried this out a couple times. Some content is easier to talk about than write about. Reviews is one. Thinking through a project ideas is another one.
* On your way to work, make eye contact with the strangers you contact with positive intention. This primes you to be open and engaged to others when you arrive. I have not tried this. I'm still bend over my phone, or deep in thoughts. But I am trying to make eye contact, say hi or smile to everybody I pass by at work.:
