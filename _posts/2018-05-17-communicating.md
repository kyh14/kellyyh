In my previous job, my 1:1's with my manager went long, with detours into movie soundtracks, future of adtech, ideation sessions. In my current job, my 1:1's with my manager are brief, often staccato status updates with clear asks on both sides. I thought the new focus meant I was more effective. While doing a training at work for 1:1's, I realized there's more to learn.

Yes, project updates are important. As a manager, I need to unblock barriers, set the right guardrails around timing and scope of deliverable, provide technical advice or general coaching. One good way to structure this is to tell your direct report to frame the work as a #win and a #struggle. The win is the thing you're proud of. The struggle is the thing you need help with. The second may be harder of the two to talk about but it may be the most fruitful: it's the jumping point for the manager to do the three things mentioned previously.

One way to get there is to have open-ended questions that prompts that reflection:
* What do you _think_...
* _Tell_ me about...
* How do you _feel_...

Underlying the ability to have an effective and frank conversation is having trust. Focus some of your time also to develop your relationship by being open about yourself personally. What's a quirk? What makes for a good coworker for you? What's something surprising people find out about you? I did this with another coworker during the training session to great effect. We laughed over how people misinterpret our face: hers is a resting bitch face, and mine a resting smile face.

Lastly, the ultimate way to earn trust is to deliver on what you promise. So end with WWDWBW - Who Will Do What By When.
