<p>I currently work at <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions">LinkedIn</a> on weekdays, and pursue my part-time MBA degree at Berkeley on weekends. </p>

<p> I was a CS and economics undergrad at MIT. I choose the majors after I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">stable marriage problem</a> in both an CS and an economics class early on. In CS, I learned that the solution is O(n^2) complexity. In economics, I learned that the algorithm solved problems like organ donor matching. I liked CS for challenging my brain to re-wire itself, and liked that economics for applying that thinking to social challenges.

<p> In <a href="http://www.thecambridgegroup.com/">consulting</a>, there was never such clear solutions. Instead, I talked to customers directly, conducted focus groups, gathered surveys. I learned to distill this info into easily understoodable frameworks, and to synthesize customers insights into broader strategy for clients.
</p>

<p> Then I went to <a href="https://www.mopub.com/">MoPub</a>, an adtech startup that was acquired by Twitter. I wore multiple hats: wrote legal policies, managed vendor relationships, created internal tools with engineers, launched new products. My favorite launch was <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/marketing/en_us/a/2015/increase-your-reach-on-and-off-twitter-with-the-twitter-audience-platform.html">Twitter Audience Platform</a>. I heped sales reps close beta clients, reported feedback back to product, brainstormed solutions with engineers, and eventually scaled it to $XXM run rate.
</p>

<p> At LinkedIn, I've build up my expertise in data science, specifically within the advertising and sales space. As a manager, I've learned to scope and define user and business painpoints into actionable and impactful projects, motivate and align cross-functional teams towards a common goal, and coach new team members to take on additional challenges.

<p> I also enjoy compiling <a href="/blog">learnings</a>, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/collection/S3e0nACRmXZCaC2BR3tIqw">restaurants</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6387043">books</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1210209051/">music</a>.
